[Field Collection](http://drupal.org/project/field_collection "") is an excellent module of Drupal, which:

> Provides a field-collection field, to which any number of fields can be attached.
> 
> A field collection is internally represented as an entity, which is embedded in the host entity. Thus, if desired field collections may be viewed and edited separately too.

Sometime you want create field collection entity dynamicly, this is trick:
